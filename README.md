The user seeks guidance on developing a book borrowing management system using Express and MongoDB for the backend, and VueJS for the frontend. The system includes several key data models:

Reader (Docgia): Stores reader information such as ID, name, birthdate, gender, address, and phone number.
Book (Sach): Contains book details like book ID, title, price, quantity, publication year, publisher ID, and author.
Publisher (NhaXuatBan): Stores publisher information including publisher ID, name, and address.
Borrowing Record (TheoDoiMuonSach): Tracks borrowing history, recording which reader borrowed which book, along with borrowing and return dates.
Employee (NhanVien): Contains employee details such as employee ID, name, password, role, address, and phone number.

The project requires setting up APIs to enable the frontend to interact with the backend, retrieving and managing data from MongoDB to display on the VueJS frontend.
